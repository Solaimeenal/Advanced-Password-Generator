# Advanced-Password-Generator

This code creates a simple Tkinter application where the user can input the desired length of the password. When the "Generate Password" button is clicked, it generates a random password of the specified length and displays it on the screen. If the user enters an invalid length (such as a non-integer or a negative number), it shows an error message.
